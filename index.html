<h3>About me</h3>

<p>Max Ellis graduated with a Master's degree from University of Alberta in June, 2022. Max Started working as a Software Engineer at Act-On in November 2022. Max quickly found his stride and fell in love with the field of software engineering, finding any opportunity he could to dive deeper and contribute, and he can safely say that he's working his hobby. Max is constantly looking to grow and become a better software engineer. He brings a unique perspective from his time as a firefighter, and is ready to roll up his sleeves and fight any virtual fires that pop up.</p>

<h2>Software Engineer II</h2>

</header>

<p class="image fit"><img src="images/act-on.jpg" alt="" /></p> 

<p> <ul>

<li>Engineered high-throughput data pipelines leveraging Spring Cloud Dataflow and Snowpipe Streaming to ensure low-latency data loading for large data volumes

</li>

<li>Upgraded an integral service from Java 8 to Java 21, developing a rollout plan to mitigate risk and an in-depth test plan to verify expected behavior with downstream dependencies

</li>

<li>Championed Customer Support escalations, allowing the team to focus on core tasks while improving customer experience

</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>

<em>As a software engineer II, I filled the same role as when I was a software engineer, but I also developed a deeper understanding of Act-On's challenges, and industry-wide problems. I implemented and shipped end-to-end features, carrying the features from the design phase through the deployment phase. I did more than assigned and held office hours to support other teams.

<h2>Software Engineer</h2>

</header>

<p class="image fit"><img src="images/act-on.jpg" alt="" /></p> 

<p>

<ul>

<li>Act-On's data lake query service outgrew it's initial design and had significant stability issues. I stabilized Act-On’s data lake service by implementing Snowflake deferred merge strategy, eliminating errors (previously 800 per hour), reducing average response time from 8 minutes to 300 milliseconds, and eliminating data duplication

</li>

<li>Built Snowflake and AWS infrastructure with terraform and puppet to set up resilient and scalable services

</li>

<li>Built a framework to migrate metadata into Snowflake from file storage, allowing for the organization to break down data silos and support a microservice-based architecture

</li>



</ul>

</p>

<p>

<em>As a software engineer at Act-On, I independently solved problems and rapidly grew as an engineer. I quickly learned about Act-On's code base and the marketing automation industry. I collaborated with my team and other teams to drive business impact and empower our customers. I added documentation to provide clarity about features, requirements, and test plans.

<h2>Research Assistant, University of Alberta</h2>

</header>

<p class="image fit"><img src="images/SMR.png" alt="" /></p> 

<p> <ul><li>Spearheaded the effort to revitalize refactoring-aware operation-based merging in a Java-based implementation. </li><li>Led a collaboration with an external collaborator. </li><li>Emulated double dispatch in Java to make operation-based merging feasible to scale and maintain. </li><li>Utilized the state-of-the-art refactoring detection tool to apply our approach to Git. </li><li>Leveraged sparsely documented third party Java libraries to programmatically perform refactorings and detect refactoring-related merge conflicts. </li><li>Performed a large-scale empirical evaluation and a systematic quantitative analysis to determine the feasibility of our approach in practice and compare with the state-of-the-art refactoring-aware merging technique, IntelliMerge.</li></ul></p>

<h2>STEM Tutor, Clark College</h2>

</header>

<p class="image fit"><img src="images/Clark.jpg" alt="" /></p> 

<p><ul><li>Assisted students at all levels with STEM fields such as computer science, math, electrical engineering, and more.</li>

<li>Helped students through a variety of methods to adapt to each student's learning style.</li>

<li>Fostered a positive and inclusive environment for all students and staff using interpersonal skills.</li></ul></p>

<p>

<em>My time as a STEM tutor was a vastly rewarding experience. First and foremost, I was able to help hundreds of students at all levels and in some cases, I got to watch students develop a passion for their field as they advanced through their program. In the process of helping them, I was able to strengthen my own problem solving skills and my computer science fundamentals, as well as developing the ability to help train new team members.</em>

<li>Eliminated false negatives compared to Git and IntelliMerge, evaluated by manually sampling 50 real-world merge scenarios.</li>

<li>Currently supports 17 of more than 72 known refactoring types.</li>

<li>Evaluation pipeline built in Java and experiments done in Python.</li></ul> </p>
