									 <p> <ul>
										 <li>Played a pivotal role in designing and implementing <b>scalable</b> Custom Objects feature, enabling customers to seamlessly integrate their structured data into the platform. Architected a sophisticated data pipeline leveraging Snowpipe streaming for <b>real-time data ingestion</b> and implemented advanced Snowflake data manipulation strategies for <b>efficient data processing at scale</b>, including Kafka integrations for downstream consumption. This system ensured data integrity and <b>high performance</b> for customer segmentation and analytics capabilities, critical high impact data throughput in the <b>production environment</b>.</li>
										 <li>Led <b>process improvement</b> initiatives by enhancing data infrastructures and stabilizing the Data Lake management service through implementation of optimized data strategies, eliminating data errors, data duplication, and <b>drastically reducing response times</b>.</li>
										 <li>Spearheaded the <b>modernization</b> of a <b>mission-critical dataflow service</b> by upgrading from Java 8 to Java 21 and consolidating distributed H2 databases into a centralized PostgreSQL system, significantly enhancing system reliability and visibility. Facilitated <b>system reliability</b> and provided improved visibility for migration from Act-On’s data center to <b>AWS cloud technologies</b>. Established comprehensive <b>monitoring and alerting systems</b> to ensure continuous system <b>health and performance in production</b>.</li>
										 <li>Engineered multiple <b>data processing pipelines</b> using SpringCloudDataFlow, enabling seamless integration between Snowflake, S3, and various internal services. Utilized SCDF to develop sophisticated ML-ready data preparation workflows.</li>
										 <li>Achieved rapid progression from Junior to Mid-level Engineer (March 2024), and subsequently to Senior (June 2025), demonstrating exceptional proficiency in <b>modern stack</b> technologies (Spring Boot, Kubernetes, Snowflake, AWS services); actively mentored junior developers and <b>collaborated across teams</b> to resolve complex technical challenges and drive improvements.</li>
