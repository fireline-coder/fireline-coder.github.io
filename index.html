									<h3>About Me</h3>
									<p>I graduated with a Master's degree from the University of Alberta in June 2022. Starting my journey as a Software Engineer at Act-On in November 2022, I quickly found my stride and developed a deep passion for the field. I constantly seek opportunities to grow, contribute, and become a better software engineer, viewing my work as a fulfilling hobby.</p>
                                    					<p>My unique perspective stems from my time as a wildland firefighter, where I learned to roll up my sleeves, adapt rapidly to changing situations, and now fight any 'virtual fires' that arise. This foundation, combined with my commitment to building resilient systems and solving complex problems at scale, fuels an unwavering drive to contribute meaningfully and engineer transformative change.</p>

                                As a Senior Software Engineer at Act-On, I've been instrumental in architecting, developing, and optimizing critical data infrastructure and services, driving significant improvements in performance, reliability, and scalability for our marketing automation platform. My tenure has involved rapid growth and an increasing scope of responsibility, tackling complex engineering challenges and contributing to strategic technical initiatives. I lead projects from design through deployment, ensuring high-quality, maintainable solutions.
                                I most recently led the design and implementation of Act-On's Custom Objects feature, building a robust, highly-available data ingestion and transformation pipeline for diverse customer datasets. This system enables real-time analytics and personalized marketing experiences.

                                <li><strong>Problem & Solution:</strong> Architected a flexible, schema-agnostic ingestion system to allow customers to integrate proprietary structured data (e.g., concert tickets, college grades, sales records) for segmentation, transforming raw input into a standardized format.</li>
                                <li><strong>Core Technologies:</strong> Leveraged Apache Kafka for high-throughput message queuing, Snowpipe Streaming for efficient streaming data ingestion into Snowflake, Deferred Merge for real-time data visibility and ensuring data integrity, and Spring Cloud Data Flow (SCDF) for orchestrating complex data transformation pipelines.</li>
                                <li><strong>Scalability & Performance:</strong> Engineered the system for dynamic scalability, processing 5 million records in less than 3 minutes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Impact & Business Value:</strong> Enabled a new, high-value product offering that expanded Act-On's capabilities, allowing precise audience segmentation and personalized campaigns. This feature opened new revenue streams and enhanced customer stickiness.</li>
